# Score-Based Diffusion Models Tutorial

This repository is dedicated to exploring the intricacies of score-based diffusion models by implementing them from scratch. The journey began with an immersion into [Harvard's remarkable seminar series on Machine Learning from scratch](https://github.com/DrugowitschLab/ML-from-scratch-seminar/tree/master), where I successfully completed their comprehensive tutorial on score-based diffusion models.

## Motivation

Understanding the inner workings of score-based diffusion models is crucial in the realm of Generative AI for image modeling. This project serves as a hands-on exploration, providing a practical and insightful perspective on the construction of these models from the ground up.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [Harvard's Drugowitsch Lab](https://github.com/DrugowitschLab) for their exceptional seminar series that laid the groundwork for this project.

Happy coding and learning!
